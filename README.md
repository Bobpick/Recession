# RecessionPredictor
This is a Python tool that predicts U.S. recession probabilities for 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months using economic data from the FRED API and a Random Forest Classifier.

## Overview
The script pulls data like GDP, yield spread, unemployment rate, CPI, and NASDAQ returns from FRED, processes it, and trains models to forecast recession odds. It outputs classification reports, the latest probabilities, and separate plots for each time horizon showing trends with recession periods shaded. Itâ€™s set to run as of March 25, 2025, with data up to February 28, 2025.

## Features
### Uses FRED Data:

- GDP
- T10Y2Y (yield spread)
- UNRATE (unemployment rate)
- CPIAUCSL (CPI)
- USREC (recession indicator)
- NASDAQCOM

### Predicts Recessions for:

- 3 months
- 6 months
- 12 months

### Random Forest Classifier with Balanced Weights

### Plots Probability Trends and Feature Trends

## Example Output from Last Run:
Predicted probabilities from 2025-02-28:
- Recession within 3 months: 8.00%
- Recession within 6 months: 4.00%
- Recession within 12 months: 0.00%

## Prerequisites
### Python Version

* Python 3.8 or higher

### FRED API Key
Get one from [fred.stlouisfed.org](http://fred.stlouisfed.org)

## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
git clone https://github.com/BobPick/RecessionPredictor.git
cd RecessionPredictor
```
2. Set up a virtual environment (optional):
   ```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Add your FRED API key:
   Open `Recession.py` and replace `'YOURKEYHERE'` with your key:
   ```python
fred = Fred(api_key='your_api_key_here')
```

## Requirements

Create a `requirements.txt` file with:

- pandas
- fredapi
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- numpy

Then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the script:
```bash
python Recession.py
```
Output:

* Console shows classification reports and latest probabilities
* Plots show 3M, 6M, and 12M probabilities plus feature trends

Customize: Change `'today'` in the script to adjust the analysis date (default: March 25, 2025)

Edit `features` list for different indicators

Update `series_ids` for other FRED data
